WITH REGRET

A major breakdown in the printing machine disrupted the process of printing and production of the entire chain of magazines of the Chandamama group of publications. We are, therefore, obliged to combine the February and March issues of our periodicals. We regret the inconvenience caused to our readers, distributors, and advertisers.
