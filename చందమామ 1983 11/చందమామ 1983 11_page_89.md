'KITTOO IS A CYCLING CHAMPION EVERY ONE ADMIRES HIM. HE WINS EVERY POSSIBLE RACE.

HE HAS WON MANY PRIZES IN CYCLING CHAMPIONSHIPS.

KITTO TELLS US THE STORY OF HIS SUCCESS.

MY CYCLE WAS ADMIRED BY ALL THE FRIENDS AND EVERYONE WANTED A TOBU CYCLE.

SOON EVERYBODY GOT A TOBU CYCLE FOR HIMSELF AND WE HAD CYCLE RACES DAILY.

WHEN I WAS A CHILD UNCLE VINOO GIFTED ME A TOBU CYCLE.

RIDING ON TOBU CYCLES WAS A PART OF MY CHILDHOOD. I PEDALLED DIFFERENT MODELS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS AS I GREW UP.

TÓBU GAVE ME CONFIDENCE AND A SPIRIT OF COMPETITION.

SMALL THINGS MATTER A LOT IN CHILDHOOD.
