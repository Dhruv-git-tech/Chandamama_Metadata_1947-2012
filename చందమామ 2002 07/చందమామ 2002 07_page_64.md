CHANDAMAMA'S
EARLY READER SERIES

CD-ROM FOR AGES: 3 & ABOVE

# JATAKA TALES

We have over a half-million words in English to communicate with, but half of everything we write and read depends on only 0.06 or just 300 words, known as 'high-frequency' words.

Early Reader Series teaches children to instantly recognize these high-frequency words through Jataka Tales.

Across media,
a common tradition!
