LET'S TAKE
AN OATH

India completes 22 years of independence today. But we have not stopped anglicizing ourselves... rather, we are outdoing the British in some ways. Even today we prefer to buy goods with English names, though they be made in India. We squander our national wealth by sending it out in great sums. Let us take an oath on this auspicious Independence Day that we shall buy and use only Indian goods, made mostly from Indian components and Indian ingredients... they are a match for any foreign manufacture. Let us pray to God to eradicate our mental slavery, and lead us to the path of real freedom. Jai Hind,
