Every toy in the Cuddles Collection is made to the standards set by our collaborators.

High quality synthetic fur used for the stuffing ensures the toys stay cuddly for years. Every Cuddles' fur is made of material with fast colours. The cute little eyes and nose are made of non-toxic plastic and are secured firmly to withstand child-handling.

The Sammo range of mechanical toys too are made to exacting standards set by Sammo Corporation of S. Korea, one of the leading toy manufacturers in the world.

Toys crafted to look like the real thing. With dynamic crackling sounds, glossy, non-fading colours.

Neatly and attractively packed to please the child and the parent.

Every little detail has been taken care of to ensure the child's safety and customer satisfaction.

Whether it is the children who play with Cuddles and the Sammo toys or the parents who buy them, these toys will keep everybody smiling.
