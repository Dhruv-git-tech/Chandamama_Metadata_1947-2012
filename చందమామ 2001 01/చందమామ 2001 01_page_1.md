Fortunately, memory doesn't run out of films...

Your camera might.

Because Orissa is such a wealth of sights and experiences, you'll be hard put to capture it all in your camera. You will find plenty to capture your mind though... The sea, that roars and foams somewhere and elsewhere, gleams calmly. The emerald forests that are home to fascinating wildlife. Lush greenery and waterfalls that cling to hills. A past that breathes in stone carved temples. A vibrant culture that finds expression in glittering events like the Konark Festival. Come to Orissa. Here's waiting a new realm of experience. Only, ensure you have enough reels of film...

ORISSA
The soul of India
