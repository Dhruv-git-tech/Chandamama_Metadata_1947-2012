Orissa : miles & miles of creativity

The first Creator was God. Man comes next. Creativity is not just the
bridesmaid of the elite and the well-read. It is a religion for the masses,
in one coastal corner of India called Orissa. Truly does Orissa revel
in the glory of her exquisite handicrafts. The artistry of the eye and
the deftness of fingers culminate in exquisite filigree work, which is
undoubtedly, the pride of Utkal, now Orissa.

The legacy of creativity, handed down from generation to generation
is not only seen in the colourful canopies and beach umbrellas, but
also in Orissa's folk Painting. Hornwork reaches it's crowning climax in
the long-legged stork. Brass and bell metal-works are the be-all and
end-all of creative imagination. That is not the end of it all. In short,
Orissa is a poem which one and all must read time after time.
