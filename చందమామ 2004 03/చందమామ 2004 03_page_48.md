# Raghurajpur: A Legacy of Creativity

10Kms from Puri and 50 kms from Bhubaneswar stands Raghurajpur - the simple but highly acclaimed coconut-palm shaded village. Silent like the gentle dew that falls in the morning, the art of patachitra, revitalised from family sketch books, has been handed down from generation to generation. This idyllic village, by the southern bank of river Bhargavi, is a rare village in India, where each family is engaged in the profession of preparing some handicraft or other... be it pata painting, ganjapa, palm leaf engravings, stone carvings, wood carvings or be it tusser painting. Many of the saviours of this art have been honoured by National Awards.

A living museum of art, tourists can see the artista, ceaselessly at work. The deft fingers of the master craftsmen aided by their family members work on this fascinating and communicative form of art.

So... it's time to lose yourself in the real Indian village of creativity and wander in the elegant pastures of Aestheticism and Art, of course, with a capital "A".
