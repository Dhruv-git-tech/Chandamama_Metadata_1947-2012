## Bewitching Belghar

In the heart of wild Orissa, spread amidst the dense sal and bamboo forests of the Eastern Ghats, this sprawling sanctuary is both picturesque and full of exhilarating possibilities. A chance encounter with a Royal Bengal Tiger can't be ruled out. Herds of elephants are part of the thick sal scape. This bewitching hideout of nature is waiting to be explored and experienced.
