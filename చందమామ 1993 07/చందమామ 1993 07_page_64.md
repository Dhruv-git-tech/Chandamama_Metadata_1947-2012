It's time to go back to school again. Time for text books. Time for games. Time to meet old friends. Time to start studying And make new ones. Time to start learning about again. Because there's so much to learn about the world around you.

From all of us here at Chandamama, have a great year in school. And remember to tell us what you've learnt everyday, when you come home from school !
