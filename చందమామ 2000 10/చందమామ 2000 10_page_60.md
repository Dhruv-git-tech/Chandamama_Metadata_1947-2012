THE AMUL
CHEESE BOY

IN PICNIC PANIC

One bright sunny day...

Little Munnu Verma
Crawls away.

Suddenly, huge rocks come
tumbling down the mountain.

...and becomes
strong and powerful.

He smashes the
falling rocks...

All thanks to the cheese
that has more milk in it.

Munnu is rescued and
back with his family.

...a picnic is in progress.

Amul cheese boy eats an
Amul cheese slice...

...reducing them to small pieces.

Amul cheese slices.
