The young and the old
react thus:

The info-park pages are very
useful as they help us to know
various facts about different
topics. (January 2008)

- S. Athreya Uppili (8), Bangalore

The page for Parents and Teachers is a
wonderful addition to the unique
Junior Chandamama. Very often, I see
my son poring over the pages when he runs to me for
a meaning, explanation or clarification. (January 2008)

- Kamaljit Arora, Chandigarh
