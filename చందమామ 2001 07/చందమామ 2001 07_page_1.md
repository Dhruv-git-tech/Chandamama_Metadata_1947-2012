KONARK

YEAARS

A saga of revival

It's about Konark... It's about 800 years of history... and 100 years of conservation.

1900 December. Destiny brought Lt. Governor Sir John Woodburn to Konark Sun Temple, which was built by King Narsimha Dev-I and had fallen prey to the vagaries of time.

He vowed to restore this 13th century epic-structure.

1901 April. Archaeological Surveyor T. Bloch unearthed a richly carved stone wheel now synonymous with Konark, the World Heritage Monument. Executive Engineer Bishan Swarup and his team did the rest. A monumental neglect of centuries stood corrected.

Konark Sun Temple, ancient India's gift to humanity. Come, enjoy and experience the magic of Konark.
