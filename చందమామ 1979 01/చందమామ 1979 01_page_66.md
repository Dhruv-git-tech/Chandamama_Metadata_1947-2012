The James Bondsons

The James Bondsons are a band of intrepid action figures, each with his or her own unique powers and abilities. They are known for their ability to cross barriers and break through any obstacle in their path.

Some of the most famous barriers they have broken include the鐵達尼號, a ship that sank after撞到山峰; the 塔林頓大厦, a tall building that was once considered impenetrable; and the Black Hole, a device that can吞下一切, including barriers.

But the James Bondsons are not just any ordinary barriers. They are barriers that are made to be broken. They are barriers that are meant to be broken. And they always are.
