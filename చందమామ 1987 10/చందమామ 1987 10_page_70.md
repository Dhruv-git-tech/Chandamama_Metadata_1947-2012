No 'flip and discard' magazine

"An issue of The Heritage is generally read more than once by its readers... usually, read in depth. Over 90% of Heritage readers preserve their copy..."

- from an IMRB survey conducted in Oct. 1986

It's an unusual magazine. It has a vision for today and tomorrow. It features ancient cities and contemporary fiction, culture and scientific developments, instead of filmstar interviews and political gossip. And it has found a growing readership, an IMRB survey reveals. Professionals, executives and their families are reading The Heritage in depth - 40% from cover to cover, 42% more than half the magazine.

More than 80% of The Heritage readers are reading an issue more than once. And over 90% are slowly building their own Heritage collection. Isn't it time you discovered why?

THE
HERITAGE

So much in store, month after month.
