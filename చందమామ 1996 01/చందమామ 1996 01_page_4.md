CHANDAMAMA BOOKS

Illustrations and production—are soon to roll out of the
nama. Written by: Manoj Das. Illustrated by Sisir Datta

A selection of legends and parables,
some of which are believed to have
been narrated by the Buddha, their ra-
diance even now undiminished.

A garland of gems from the great treasure
of India's folklore and ancient fiction.
Each story has a message, as relevant
today as it was ever before.

An invitation into the delightful world of
ancient tales, legends and parables.
Each story enriches us with prudence
and helps us understand life better.
