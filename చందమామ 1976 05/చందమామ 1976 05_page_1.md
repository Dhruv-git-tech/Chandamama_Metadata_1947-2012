On the occasion of the publication of 'Chandamama' in Assamese, I offer my congratulations to the Chandamama publications on the services they have rendered to the cause of children as well as of Indian languages. I am happy to send my greetings and good wishes to the children of Assam through your magazine and wish the publication success. I hope that it will disseminate information which will help enlarge the vision and widen the knowledge of children.
