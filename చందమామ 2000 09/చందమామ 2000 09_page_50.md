THE AMUL
CHEESE BOY

IN PICNIC PANIC

One bright sunny day...

...a picnic is in progress.

Little Munnu Verma
crawls away.

Suddenly, huge rocks come
tumbling down the mountain.

Amul cheese boy eats an
Amul cheese slice...

...and becomes
strong and powerful.

He smashes the
falling rocks...

...reducing them to small pieces.

Munnu is rescued and
back with his family.

All thanks to the cheese
that has more milk in it.

Amul cheese slices.
