Let's make the world a sweeter place to live in.

I'm planting a Tulsi tree.
Hope it grows into a
B-I-I-G one.

Lovable, blind Chacha
Kunwar. He's been my
parents' guide. The least
I can do is help him
cross safely.

Ahal This time Dad's
got the flu and Mum's
told me to give him a
dose of medicine.

Gangu Bai has coolly
taken the day off. Leaving
Radha Mausi and me in a
soapy mess.

Before that rich glutton
of a Raju snatches my
Kaju Barfi, let me give it
to poor Smita..

Naughty Timmy has got
himself hurt. Now this lil'
Doc will set him right.

I'm helping Uncle Rajeev
with the car repairs.
Though Mum said "I'll be
a spanner in the works".

With Chandra, my maths
teacher, numbers are fun.
Time I gave her a dozen
smiling roses.
