Rathayatra

THE EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME.

Welcome to the grand roadshow. Welcome to the frenzy, the ecstasy and the grandeur that is Rathayatra. It throws up a vibrant and captivating display of age-old tradition, mythology, culture and lore of Orissa. The divine journey proceeds down Puri's broadway every year with the idols of Lord Jagannath, His brother Balabhadra and His sister, Subhadra travelling in three gigantic chariots, borne on 16 enormous wheels. Millions of devotees heave at the ropes to draw their Gods' chariots. This 1st July, 2003 the divine rathas will roll out again in their full regalia. Be at Puri to witness this magnificent pageant of life!
