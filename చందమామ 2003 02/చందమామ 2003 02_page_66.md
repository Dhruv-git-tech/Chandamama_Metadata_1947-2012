SPECIALTY DESIGNED
FOR CHILDREN BELOW
9 YEARS

Good news parents and teachers!

We are happy to introduce **JUNIOR CHANDAMAMA**, a new magazine for your tiny tots.

From April 2003 onwards, **JUNIOR CHANDAMAMA** will entertain your tiny tots month after month with many pages of fun and learning.

This magazine will present a package of contests, activities, and puzzles specially designed for children up to the age of 9.

The magazine will endeavour to impart both global and traditional Indian values to children through little stories and activities.

At Rs. 10 per copy, and an annual subscription at Rs. 120, **JUNIOR CHANDAMAMA** promises to be easy on your monthly budgets, too!

As a pre-launch discount offer, an annual subscription of **JUNIOR CHANDAMAMA** will be offered to you at Rs.100/- instead of Rs.120/- for a limited period only.

We hope you will avail this offer.

Those interested can write to us with your name and address for a free sample copy of the introductory issue of **JUNIOR CHANDAMAMA**.
