# Symphony on Stone

Sculpted as the celestial chariot of the Sun God, Konark is the quintessence of Orissan School of temple architecture, dating back to 13th century AD. Built by King Langula Narasimha Dev, this monument is a sheer poetry on stone. Although only the Mukhasala - the entrance hall - has remained intact, this magnificent ruin, amidst the sand dunes by the seashore, has on its walls sculptures of immense beauty, covering every aspect of life. Pulled by seven exquisitely carved horses, the chariot-temple had twenty-four wheels, with intricate designs, representing time, unity, completeness, justice and movement. The temple was conceived to be a total picture of the entire gamut of social and cultural life of the time and the people. Besides being a major attraction for the connoisseurs and common men alike, Konark finds place in the World Heritage List, being a monument of global importance in Eastern India.
