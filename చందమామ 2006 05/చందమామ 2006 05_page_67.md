## WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO MEET THIS MOTELY CROWD?

INDU and CHANDU who are travel bugs, found in Assam one month and Andhra Pradesh in the next.

BHOLA who is confused with everything, whether it is about his family or farm-house.

MINTOO whose mates include rhinos and hippos, otters and frogs.

NAUGHTY BALOO who never misses a chance to get into a scrape.

MUNNA whose world consists of flowers and feline creatures.

ASTRO ARIA who prefers to travel into space.

GOOBA who can be called a wordsmith.

NUTTY who plays with numbers.

And the one and only BHEEM BOY.

Where can we meet them?
C'mon quick!

Where else but in Junior Chandamama!
