THE FESTIVAL SEASON IS ON!
CHANDAMAMA OFFERS THE IDEAL GIFT FOR YOUR DEAR ONES

With a simple click and
drag movement of the
mouse, Chandamama
Fun Workshop promises
hours of fun.

We have over a half-million
words in English to communicate with,
but half of everything we write and
read depends on 500 most frequently used
words. But many of these words cannot
be sounded out, so they must be
learned as sight words.

JATAKA TALES - Early Reader Series (Level 2)
teaches children to instantly recognise
100 of these sight words.

LEVEL II

The renowned Indologist
Professor Purenuthin is trapped
Inside the Mound of Murukki.
You search through 12 different
games and activities to find clues
and keys to save the professor.
