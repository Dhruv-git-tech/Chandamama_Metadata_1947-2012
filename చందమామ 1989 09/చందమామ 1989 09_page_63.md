Everyday while a new India emerges, the existence and memory of the old one slowly fades.

The once-familiar sounds and sights, the beauty of Indian traditions and values, the ethnic and historical identity of its people, the once prolific art and handicrafts of rural India; a heritage is vanishing. Discover a part of that real India through the pages of The Heritage.

It's an unusual magazine. It has a vision for today and tomorrow. It features ancient cities and contemporary fiction, culture and scientific developments, instead of filmstar interviews and political gossip. And it has found a growing readership, an IMRB survey reveals. Professionals, executives and their families are reading The Heritage in depth – 40% from cover to cover, 42% more than half the magazine.

More than 80% of The Heritage readers are reading an issue more than once. And over 90% are slowly building their own Heritage collection.
