PRIME MINISTER

MESSAGE

Our children need books and journals which will awaken their minds to the marvels of creation and the living universe of ideas. Publications for children must arouse imagination, create aesthetic awareness, encourage the desire for knowledge and at the same time teach them to live in harmony with their own society and the world.

My good wishes for the continued success of "Chandamama".
