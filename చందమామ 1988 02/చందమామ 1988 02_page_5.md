It's an unusual magazine. It has a vision for today and tomorrow.

It features ancient cities and contemporary fiction, culture and scientific developments, instead of filmstar interviews and political gossip. And it has found a growing readership, an IMRB survey reveals. Professionals, executives and their families are reading

The Heritage in depth—40% from cover to cover, 42% more than half the magazine.

More than 80% of The Heritage readers are reading an issue more than once. And over 90% are slowly building their own Heritage collection.

Isn't it time you discovered why?

The
HERITAGE

So much in store, month after month.
