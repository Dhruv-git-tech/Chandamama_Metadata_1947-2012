Chandamama

Art Book

'Chandamama Art Book' brought back my childhood memories. Illustrations by artists Vaddadi Papayya garu, Sankar, Chitra, MTV Acharya are pretty to look at, a healthy treat to the eyes that leaves a wonderful impression on my mind. This 'art book' experiment, with quality printing, looking lovely, is an extraordinary gift to art lovers. It is a precious treasure that is worth keeping forever.

With Best Wishes,
