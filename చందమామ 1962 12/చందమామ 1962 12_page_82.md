# Publisher's Appeal

Dear Reader,

I am writing this letter in our national emergency created by the Chinese aggression on the frontiers of our Sacred Motherland. I am confident you are all aware of the events. At this juncture I remind you of the age old maxim 'UNITED WE STAND.'

Now is the time for us to unite and give our full support to our Government.

I APPEAL to you to contribute your mite in cash and gold to the NATIONAL DEFENCE FUND and strengthen the hands of our beloved Prime Minister, Chacha NEHRU in the noble cause of driving off the aggressor.

JAI HIND

Yours Sincerely,

5-11-1962

B. V. REDDI
